 <p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px;'>
    The housing market in Ireland has been facing very distinct curves in the past two decades along with a big recession that reached its peak in 2008 to a descending curve since, by 2013 the housing market started to reverse to a positive growth,
    although this positive variance has not been strong enough to solve the crisis as the analyses has shown, yet this is not a real portrait of the issue, as a majority of the tenants are not officially registered in The Private Tenancies Board(PRTB). From the analyses of the Census of 2016 the CSO has concluded that there are 2.48 people per private property in Dublin City,
    although news as “Fifteen people sharing one room in house with 70 tenants” in Dublin City from the Independent.ie in 2017 are actually not as alarming.
    As it is a market the analyses and visualization will be divided between supply and demand using Python 3 with Jupyter Notebook, pandas, numpy, Bokeh, Matplotlib, Seaborm, Flask among others to find insights to support a solution to the issue

<h5 style='margin-top: 15x; margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px; font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #C0504D; font-style: italic;'> House Stock </h5>
<p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px; margin-bottom: 1px;'>
The CSO has been providing an extensive amount of data of the house stock in Ireland from the insights taken of Census in over two decades.
The house stock in Ireland had a consistent growth until 2011 when it shifts to a very passive period; in contrast Dublin had a low growth throughout the years.

<h5 style='margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px; font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #C0504D; font-style: italic;'>Vacant Properties </h5>
<p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px; margin-bottom: -1px;'>
The number of vacant properties in Ireland grew 85.7% from 2002 to 2006 to a negative growth of 15.2% from 2011 to 2016.</p>

</center>

<p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px;'>
In 2016 12.25% of the house stock was vacant, from those vacant properties 47.85% were rural, the long term properties and the deceased properties reached over 5,000 vacant properties each, 
and from an urban perspective it shifts to a majority of properties for sale or rent, 22.84%. Proportionally Dublin had a considerable amount of vacant properties for rental compared to the rest of the country, 
when you consider that Dublin had 26.5% of the properties in Ireland in 2016, despite of this amount Dublin had nearly half of the properties for sale in market in 2016. These numbers shift to a negative growth 
as the housing market had significant growth of existing properties registered in the new transactions.</p>
<h5 style='margin: 8px; margin-top: 12; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #C0504D; font-style: italic;'>Properties Transactions </h5>
<p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px; margin-bottom:0px'>
The overall number of transactions of properties in Ireland had a variance of 190% from 2010 to 2018.</p>

<div class='bokeh'>

</div>
</center>
<p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px;'>
The existing house transactions had a variance of 216.9%, as there were still a considerable number of vacant properties available in the market, while the transactions 
of new properties variance was not as prominent with 54.6%. Dublin did follow a different path with a variance of 284.7% for new properties transactions and 162.9% for
 existing properties, mostly reflexes of a saturated housing market.</p>

<p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px;'>
The Irish housing market has been troubling since the recession to reach a sustainable growth, as the chart below verifies.</p>

</center>
<p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px; margin-top: 9px;'>
In 2011 Dublin had only 140 new properties registered reaching its lowest point since from the data available, while Ireland reached its lowest point in 2012 with only 
627 new properties registered. There was no significant variance until 2016 when the government along with other bodies launched numerous projects with possible “solutions”.</p>

<h5 style='margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px; font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; color: #C0504D; font-style: italic;'>New non-occupier buyers</h5>

<p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px; margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom: 0px;'>
Another relevant insight this dataset provides is the high correlation between new and existing properties transactions.
There are various articles published that stressed the growth of cash-only sales in Ireland, although there is not enough data available to verify this tendency, 
despite that the CSO also provided data on the number of buyers that are non-occupier, non-householder or former owner occupier(2nd mortgage) throughout the years,
 i.e., those are utilizing the housing market as an investment and influencing the rental and sales prices to increase. Unite Nations has sent a letter to the Irish government describing the situation as <spam style='font-style: italic'>“moderately unaffordable”</spam>.<br>
The number of non-occupier buyers in fact propelled the Irish Housing Market, with a high deviation from 2013 with 8478 transactions to 12799 in 2014(50.7%).

<center><p><img style='width: 30%; height: 30%; float: left; align: bottom; margin-top: 7px;' src={{url_for('static', filename='images/CorrelationTotals1.png')}}></center>
<p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px; margin-top: 1px;'>
In the chart above it is noticeable how the total of non-occupiers has been a considerable share in the overall transactions, with emphasis between 2010 to 2013 where 
those buyers would take advantage of a fragile market; from 2014 onwards a strong consistency. These buyers are more focused in the existing properties, which will mostly 
be redesigned to accommodate more people, allowing these investments to be capitalized in a shorter time. The total of transactions registered and the total of non-occupier 
transactions registered had a strong correlation between them, as the correlation chart on the left verifies, which supports the fact that those investments are inflating the housing market.

<p style='font-size:15px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 7px; margin-right:7px; margin-top: 1px;'>
The CSO using data from Census 2016 produced a dataset of the Irish population by counties. In 2016 Ireland had a population of 4,761,865 people.
With panda's groupby, Bokeh and GeoJson(GIS), it is possible to visualize how the Irish population is divided, and the most density populated areas. 
Dublin had 1,461 people per km2, and consisted 28.3% of the Irish population in 2106, while comprising only 1.09% of the country's territory, 
followed by Cork with 11.4% of the country's population although with a demographic density of 72.4 people per km2.
